# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Overview:
Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review. The purpose of this analysis is to search through Amazon review data sets to try and uncover trends related to these paid reviewers. I chose to focus on the data set containing reviews of video game listings.

# Results:
* The data set contained 1781706 regular reviews and 4291 reviews from the paid Amazon Vine members.
* There were 1607 Vine reviewers who gave 5 stars. And 1025317 regular 5 star reviews.
* As shown in the picture below, 57% of all reviews were 5 star, but that drops to 37% when looking at the Vine reviews. <br>

# Conclusion: 
The people who were obligated to submit a review were less likely to give a perfect score. However, there isn't a high enough volume of these Paid vine reviews to make a difference on the overall average for a listing.
